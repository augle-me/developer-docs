# Overview of Direct Apps

Direct apps, one of the primary app types supported by Augle and the only other type is Via Apps. 
Direct apps gives a developer more freedom to work on the Augle Platform, because they are developed and deployed
by the developers themselves reaching wider audience across the globle. 
Developers has to take care of the content development, publishing and location (Augle Perimeters)
Of course, they can always contact Augle support for any issues.

## Why they named as Direct apps?
<hr/>
Direct apps are deployed directly on to Augle Perimeters by the Developer . There is no other party(Business or Agency) invovlved between Developer and Augle 
Hence the name "Direct Apps"


## Design principles of a Direct app
<hr/>
1. The App has a Specific value @ Specific Location or within a proximity range (i.e Augle perimeter) 
2. The content is useful to the Mobile user while indentified within the proximity range 
3. Direct Apps are always public, they can never be private 

Note:
Direct app will only have end user UI. All the Augle SDK features are available to the developer but with few limitations
such as App can never be made private.


## How the direct apps delivered
<hr/>
There are 3 types of distribution channels for the Direct apps
while you publish the through developer console

 - **Google Place**
 - **Augle and Community Perimeter**
 - **General**

You can use all three distribution channels or combination of three to increase your app audience. Moreover, the content of the App you
would be developing will also determine the type of distribution channel you should choose. 

**Google Place:** Using this distribution channel, you can deploy your app to the Google place Id. You have a provision of
adding maximum of 10 Google Place Id to you app. However, make sure you do not usually have apps at two different places. If you
think that your app can serve the purpose that the place id they you can go ahead and add them. [Read More]()

**Augle and Community perimeter:** Augle team will create few perimeters which can't have owner and these are usually public places,
where these perimeter have no sole legal ownership except Govt. In addition, there are few perimeters, which were created
by the community. Direct apps can deployed to these locations when developer using this distribution channel.
You have a provision of adding maximum of 10 Augle or Community perimeters. [Read More]()

**General:** In case your app doesn't belongs to specific location and it belongs to specific type of locations then you 
can deploy using General Distribution Channel to increase you app audience.
